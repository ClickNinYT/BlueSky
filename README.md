 # What is BlueSky?
 BlueSky (originally is DynoLTS Plus) is a Minecraft for Windows 10 (or 11) launcher. It allow you to play the game without owning it, or act as a replacement for new Gamepass launcher (if you are not like it). BlueSky is the successor to DynoLTS, Dyno, Berial and dotClick!Go Launcher. Also, BlueSky is safer than alternatives because of how regularly it was updated and we also having a strong community that can help you each time problems occurs!

 # Is BlueSky illegal?
 Technically, yes. Since you are still playing Minecraft without paying, and that is illegal. But on other side, BlueSky still allowing you to do a "clean" launch. So that's depending on how you using BlueSky.

 # Development
 BlueSky development started from 4/2021 and has been evoled into multiple versions (such as Beta 2, Beta4 or latest is Beta 13). Currently all development is focused on Beta 14 which will focus on bug fixes and new features.

 # Installation
 You can install BlueSky by downloading precompiled binaries or compile BlueSky from source. Downloading precompiled binaries will save you a lot of time while compiling BlueSky from source will allow you to get latest features earlier. Compiling guide will be in the next part, if you want precompiled binaries, just go to Releases tab, get the one with "Latest" string and download it. Extract the file, go to inside, open BlueSkyNew.exe and enjoy using BlueSky!

 # Compilation
 You can clone the source using git or by using Github's Clone ZIP function. After that, you will need Visual Studio 2022 with .NET Development SDK installed. Open the solution file and press Start. Compiling from CLI is also supported but I will not provide any support for it.
